# Data Warehouse Service

A high-performance data warehouse service built with **Moose** for real-time data ingestion, processing, and analytics. This service provides APIs for data extraction from multiple sources (S3, Datadog) and supports streaming data pipelines with ClickHouse as the storage backend.

## Overview

The Data Warehouse Service is designed to handle large-scale data ingestion and processing with the following key capabilities:

- **Real-time Data Ingestion**: Stream data processing with RedPanda
- **Multi-Source Data Extraction**: Support for S3, Datadog, and custom connectors
- **REST API**: Query interface for accessing stored data
- **Scalable Storage**: ClickHouse backend for high-performance analytics
- **Workflow Engine**: Temporal-based data processing workflows
