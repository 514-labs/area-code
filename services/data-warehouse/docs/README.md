# Presenter - Demo walkthrough doc

## Launching the demo
To launch the Data Warehouse, open a terminal window in the root of the Area-code repo.

Then navigate to the data-warehouse project:

```sh
cd services/data-warehouse/
```

Once there, run the one-time setup/install command - if you haven't already done so.

```sh
./setup.sh setup
```

The setup script will install the required Python dependencies.

Next run the setup start command to launch the demo.
This will launch the moose data warehouse server and web-based front-end.

```sh
./setup.sh start
```

When you're done you can simply run the stop command to shutdown the demo.

```sh
./setup.sh stop
```
