# Area Code - User-Facing Analytics Starter Application

---

> ⚠️ **ALPHA RELEASE** - This is an early alpha version under active development. We are actively testing on different machines and adding production deployment capabilities. Use at your own risk and expect breaking changes.

Area Code is a production-ready starter repository with all the necessary building blocks for building multi-modal applications with real-time analytics, transactional data, and search capabilities.

## Prerequisites

### Thesys API Key Setup

The UFA application includes AI-powered chat functionality that requires a Thesys API key:

1. **Get an API key**: Visit [console.thesys.dev](https://console.thesys.dev/keys) to create an account and generate an API key
2. **Create a `.env.local` file** in the transactional service directory (`services/transactional-supabase-foobar/`):
   ```bash
   THESYS_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

This enables the Aurora MCP (Model Context Protocol) which provides AI tools for intelligent data analysis and querying across your multi-modal backend.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes with our automated setup:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm install

# 2. Start development environment
pnpm ufa:dev

# 3. Seed databases with sample data (in a new terminal)
pnpm ufa:dev:seed

# 4. Open front-end
http://localhost:5173/
```

This will:

- Seed transactional database with 1M foo records and 100K bar records
- Migrate data to analytical database (ClickHouse)
- Start Elasticsearch migration for search capabilities
- Restart workflows for real-time synchronization

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
pnpm ufa:dev              # Start all services
pnpm ufa:dev:clean        # Clean all services
pnpm ufa:dev:seed         # Seed databases with sample data

# Individual services
pnpm --filter vite-web-base dev          # Frontend only
pnpm --filter transactional-base dev      # Transactional API only
pnpm --filter analytical-base dev         # Analytical API only
pnpm --filter retrieval-base dev          # Search API only
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment (Coming Soon)

> 🚧 **UNDER DEVELOPMENT** - Production deployment capabilities are actively being developed and tested. The current focus is on stability and compatibility across different machine configurations.

We're working on a production deployment strategy that will be available soon.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

> 🔬 **TESTING STATUS** - We are actively testing on various machine configurations. Currently tested on Mac M3 Pro (18GB RAM), M4 Pro, and M4 Max. We're expanding testing to more configurations.

### Common Issues

1. **Node Version**: Ensure you're using Node 20+ (required for Moose)
2. **Memory Issues**: Elasticsearch requires significant memory (4GB+ recommended)

**Tested Configurations:**

- ✅ Mac M3 Pro (18GB RAM)
- ✅ Mac M4 Pro
- ✅ Mac M4 Max
- 🔄 More configurations being tested

### Reset Environment

```bash
# Clean all services
pnpm ufa:dev:clean

# Restart development
pnpm ufa:dev
```
