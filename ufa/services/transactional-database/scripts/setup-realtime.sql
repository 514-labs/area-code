-- Comprehensive setup script for enabling PostgreSQL realtime changes
-- This script follows the Supabase documentation for setting up realtime
-- Includes support for foo, bar for sync-service service
-- Run this script after setting up your database tables

-- Enable Row Level Security for all tables
ALTER TABLE "foo" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE "bar" ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for foo table
-- Allow authenticated users to read all foo records
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read foo"
ON "foo"
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to insert foo records
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert foo"
ON "foo"
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to update foo records
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update foo"
ON "foo"
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to delete foo records
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete foo"
ON "foo"
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- Create policies for bar table
-- Allow authenticated users to read all bar records
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read bar"
ON "bar"
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to insert bar records
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert bar"

-- Allow authenticated users to update bar records
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update bar"

-- Allow authenticated users to delete bar records
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete bar"

-- Anonymous access policies for sync-service service
-- These policies are required for the sync-service service to receive realtime events
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous access to foo"

FOR SELECT

CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous access to bar"
ON "bar"

-- Set replica identity to full for all tables to receive old record data
-- This is needed to get the old record values in UPDATE and DELETE events
ALTER TABLE "foo" REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
ALTER TABLE "bar" REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;

-- Grant necessary permissions for realtime
-- These grants allow the realtime system to access the tables
GRANT SELECT ON "foo" TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON "bar" TO authenticated;

-- Grant permissions for anonymous access (required for sync-service service)
GRANT SELECT ON "foo" TO anon;
GRANT SELECT ON "bar" TO anon;

-- Grant service_role access for testing and administration
GRANT ALL ON "foo" TO service_role;
GRANT ALL ON "bar" TO service_role;

-- Additional grants for any custom roles you might have
-- GRANT SELECT ON "foo" TO your_custom_role;
-- GRANT SELECT ON "bar" TO your_custom_role;
